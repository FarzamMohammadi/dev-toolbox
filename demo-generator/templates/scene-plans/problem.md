# Problem Scene

## Purpose
Make the viewer feel the pain. Establish the problem clearly so the solution feels earned.

## Duration
5-15 seconds

## Content Formula
- **Name the problem** concisely
- **Show the pain** — a visual representation of the current bad experience
- **Quantify if possible** — numbers make problems concrete

## Recommended Animations
- `typewriter` for showing messy/broken workflows (terminal style feels raw)
- `fade-slide` for stacking pain points one by one
- `counter` for showing bad metrics counting up
- `text-scramble` to reveal a painful truth

## Beat Alignment
- Open with the problem statement on a downbeat
- Stack additional pain points on subsequent beats
- Leave a beat of silence/pause before transitioning to solution

## Design Notes
- Slightly desaturated colors or red accents convey friction
- Show "before" state — messy, manual, slow
- Can use terminal/code styling to show ugly manual processes
- Build tension — this is the low point before the solution
