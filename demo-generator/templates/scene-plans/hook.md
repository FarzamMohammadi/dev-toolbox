# Hook Scene

## Purpose
First impression. 3-8 seconds of pure attention capture. The viewer decides in this moment whether to keep watching.

## Duration
3-8 seconds (2-8 beats at 120 BPM)

## Content Formula
Pick ONE approach:
- **Bold stat** that reframes the problem ("97% of receipts are still processed manually")
- **Provocative question** ("What if your entire dev stack started with one click?")
- **Visual surprise** — an unexpected animation that demands attention
- **Contradiction** — two opposing ideas that create tension

## Recommended Animations
- `text-scramble` for the main statement (decodes to reveal — high impact)
- `fade-slide` for subtitle/context (secondary info slides in after)
- `counter` if using a stat (number counts up dramatically)
- `ripple` for a visual punch on reveal

## Beat Alignment
- Beat 1-2: Background or ambient visual starts (subtle)
- Beat 3-4: Main text scramble begins (the hook)
- Beat 5-8: Text fully revealed, subtitle fades in

## Design Notes
- Keep text SHORT. 8 words max for the main line
- Use large typography (`.display` or `.heading-1`)
- Dark background, bright text — maximum contrast
- One idea only. Don't explain — intrigue
