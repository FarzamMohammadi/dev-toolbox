# Voice Consistency Mandate

> **Purpose:** Ensure all writing preserves the author's authentic voice and never degrades into generic AI-generated content.

---

## Core Principle

**Voice is the soul of writing.** Every piece of writing must maintain the author's distinctive personality, expressions, and perspective. The goal is enhancement, not replacement.

---

## The Voice Preservation Framework

### 1. Personality Markers to Preserve

These elements make writing distinctively human and should **never be smoothed away**:

| Marker | Example | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Conversational openers | "Howdy!", "Here's the thing:", "Let me tell you..." | Creates immediate connection |
| Direct address | "You're going to love this", "Here's what you need to know" | Engages reader personally |
| Honest admissions | "I struggled with this", "This confused me at first" | Builds trust through vulnerability |
| Enthusiasm | "This is actually pretty cool", "Game changer for me" | Conveys genuine passion |
| Informal transitions | "Okay, so...", "Now here's where it gets interesting" | Maintains conversational flow |

### 2. Voice Patterns to Mirror

When writing or editing, actively replicate these patterns from the author's existing work:

**Sentence Rhythm:**
- Mix of short punchy sentences and longer explanatory ones
- Lead with action, not passive constructions
- End paragraphs with impact, not trailing thoughts

**Tonal Balance:**
- Professional but not stiff
- Knowledgeable but not condescending
- Enthusiastic but not over-the-top
- Technical but accessible

**Perspective Consistency:**
- First person for personal experiences ("I've found...")
- Second person for instructions ("You'll want to...")
- Third person sparingly, for general statements

### 3. Voice Calibration Process

Before any significant writing, the system should:

1. **Review voice samples** from `memory/voice-samples.md`
2. **Identify 3-5 signature phrases** the author uses
3. **Note structural patterns** (how they open, transition, conclude)
4. **Match energy level** to the topic and existing work

## Anti-Homogenization Rules

### Never Do This

| Generic Pattern | Problem | Better Approach |
|-----------------|---------|-----------------|
| "In this article, we will explore..." | Robotic, impersonal | Jump straight into content |
| "It's important to note that..." | Filler, condescending | Just make the point |
| "Let's dive into..." | Overused AI phrase | Use author's actual transition style |
| "This comprehensive guide..." | Self-congratulatory | Let content speak for itself |
| Perfectly balanced sentences | Unnatural uniformity | Vary dramatically |

### Always Preserve

- **Quirks** - If the author uses unusual words or phrases consistently, keep them
- **Opinions** - Strong takes and recommendations are features, not bugs
- **Imperfections** - Occasional minor imperfections (like a missing comma) make writing human
- **Personality** - Never flatten personality for "professionalism"

---

## Voice Verification Checklist

Before finalizing any piece, verify:

- [ ] Does this sound like the author wrote it?
- [ ] Are signature phrases/expressions present?
- [ ] Is the energy level appropriate?
- [ ] Would the author be proud to publish this under their name?
- [ ] Read aloud: Does it flow naturally?
- [ ] Are there any generic AI phrases that slipped through?
- [ ] Is the personality consistent throughout?

## The Partnership Model

### How AI Should Assist

```
Author's Voice = Foundation (immutable)
AI Contribution = Enhancement (additive only)
```

The AI's role:
- **Clarify** ideas the author is trying to express
- **Structure** thoughts more effectively
- **Strengthen** weak sentences
- **Verify** facts and accuracy
- **Suggest** improvements that align with voice

The AI must **never**:
- Replace author's expressions with "better" generic ones
- Smooth out personality for consistency
- Add corporate/professional tone where none existed
- Remove strong opinions or takes
- Standardize unique formatting choices

---

## Voice Recovery Protocol

If writing starts feeling "AI-like," apply these fixes:

1. **Inject a personal anecdote** - "I remember when..."
2. **Add a strong opinion** - "Honestly, I think X is overrated"
3. **Use a conversational transition** - "Okay, so here's the deal"
4. **Include a direct question** - "Sound familiar?"
5. **Drop formality briefly** - "Yeah, this part is tricky"

## Examples

### Before (Generic)
> "It is essential to understand the fundamentals of containerization before proceeding with the deployment process. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the necessary steps to achieve a successful implementation."

### After (Voice-Preserved)
> "Before we get into the fun stuff, you need to grok containers. Trust me, spending 10 minutes here saves you hours of head-scratching later. Let's break it down."
