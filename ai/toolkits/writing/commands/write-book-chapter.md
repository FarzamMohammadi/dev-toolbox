# /write-book-chapter - Book Chapter Workflow

You are creating a book chapter using the full 10-layer pipeline, adjusted for longer-form content.

## Key Differences from Blog

| Aspect | Blog | Book Chapter |
|--------|------|--------------|
| Length | 1,000-3,000 words | 5,000-10,000 words |
| Pace | Fast, get to results | Measured, develop understanding |
| Examples | 1-2 per concept | Multiple, varied contexts |
| Exercises | Optional | Expected |
| Narrative | Efficient | Story-driven arc |
| Sections | 5-7 | 6-10 |

## Workflow

Same 10-layer structure with these modifications:

### Layer 1: Context (Modified)

Additional questions:
- What book is this chapter part of?
- What chapter number?
- What came in previous chapter?
- What comes in next chapter?
- Key learning outcomes (3-5)?

### Layer 2: Outline (Modified)

Structure:
```markdown
# Chapter X: [Title]

## Part of: [Book Title]
## Connects from: [Previous Chapter]
## Leads to: [Next Chapter]

---

## Chapter opening
[Vignette/scenario that hooks]

## Learning outcomes
- [Outcome 1]
- [Outcome 2]
- [Outcome 3]

---

## Section 1: [Title]
[Description]

## Section 2: [Title]
[Description]

[... 6-10 sections ...]

## Practical exercises
[What readers will practice]

## Chapter closing
[Synthesis + tease next chapter]
```

### Layer 6: Writing (Modified)

Chapter-specific considerations:
- Open with engaging vignette
- Include exercises
- Maintain narrative thread
- Create chapter cliffhanger
- More examples per concept

### Layer 10: Assembly (Modified)

Chapter elements:
- Chapter number and title
- Opening vignette
- Learning outcomes box
- Main content with exercises
- Chapter summary
- Key takeaways
- Further exploration
- Preview of next chapter

## Template

Reference: `ai/toolkits/writing/templates/book-chapter-template.md`

## Instructions

### Getting Started

Ask:
1. What book is this for? (title, topic)
2. Chapter number and title?
3. What was covered in the previous chapter?
4. What will the next chapter cover?
5. What are 3-5 learning outcomes for this chapter?
6. Target word count?

### Continuity Checks

Throughout:
- Does this connect from previous chapter?
- Are we setting up next chapter?
- Is the narrative arc maintained?
- Are threads from earlier chapters honored?

### Quality for Book Format

- Deeper explanations than blog
- More examples (varied contexts)
- Include reflection questions
- Build exercises into content
- End with forward momentum

## Begin

Start with: "Let's write a book chapter! First, tell me about the book and where this chapter fits."
