## Session 1: 2026-01-09 (Initial Session)

### Duration
~Extended session (comprehensive planning)

### Goal
Create the ultimate prompt engineering directory for AI-assisted senior software engineering

### What Happened

**Phase 1: Research**
- Conducted extensive web searches on:
  - CLAUDE.md patterns and best practices
  - MCP ecosystem (servers, tools, security)
  - AI coding agents (Cursor, Claude Code, Aider)
  - Hooks and automation
  - Multi-agent systems
  - Code quality tools
  - Testing with AI
  - Memory and context persistence
  - Security guardrails
  - Self-improvement techniques
- Explored user's existing setup (LeetCode Tutor prompts v1-v4)

**Phase 2: User Discovery**
- Captured preferences through structured questions:
  - 80/20 collaboration style
  - Very opinionated feedback wanted
  - Strategic comments only
  - Ask when unclear
  - Full-stack + AI engineering focus
  - Personal use (not team)
- Identified pain points:
  - Multiple prompts for polish
  - Lack of big picture thinking
  - Not going above and beyond
  - Not using web search
  - Not challenging assumptions

**Phase 3: Documentation**
- Created `ULTIMATE-DIRECTORY-MASTER-PLAN.md` (~1000 lines)
  - 14 sections of industry research
  - 7 creative concept sections
  - Ready-to-use philosophy blocks
  - Complete inventory (9 philosophy, 5 personas, 20+ skills, 20+ agents)
  - Directory structure proposal
- Created `IMPLEMENTATION-PHASES.md` (~400 lines)
  - 8 phases prioritized by pain points
  - Bullet point format for quick reference
  - Clear next steps

**Phase 4: Context Relay Agent**
- Created agent to solve context window limitations
- Established memory file structure
- Generated handoff system for seamless session continuation

### Artifacts Created
1. `ULTIMATE-DIRECTORY-MASTER-PLAN.md`
2. `IMPLEMENTATION-PHASES.md`
3. `agents/meta/context-relay-agent.md`
4. `SESSION-STATE.md`
5. `memory/learnings.md`
6. `memory/decisions.md`
7. `memory/session-history.md`
8. `HANDOFF-PROMPT.md`

### State at End
- Planning complete
- Ready to implement Phase 1 (philosophy/CORE.md)
- No blockers

### Key Insights
- User values tight partnership over pure execution
- Context continuity is critical pain point
- Quality bar is extremely high
- Philosophy should be language-agnostic
- Pain point resolution drives priority

*Next session should begin with reading SESSION-STATE.md and HANDOFF-PROMPT.md*
