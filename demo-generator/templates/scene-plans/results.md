# Results Scene

## Purpose
Show outcomes and metrics. Prove that it works with numbers, comparisons, or testimonials.

## Duration
5-15 seconds

## Content Formula
- **Key metrics** — the numbers that matter most (2-4 max)
- **Before/after comparison** — concrete improvement
- **Social proof** if available — quotes, user counts, stars

## Recommended Animations
- `counter` for metrics counting up (the star of this scene)
- `fade-slide` with stagger for metric cards appearing
- `text-scramble` for a summary statement

## Beat Alignment
- Each metric reveals on a beat
- Counter animations start on downbeats for maximum impact
- Quick pace — results should feel punchy and confident

## Design Notes
- Use large numbers — `.display` or `.heading-1` size
- Color-code improvements (green for good, accent colors for emphasis)
- Cards/panels work well for organizing multiple metrics
- Keep it scannable — viewer should get it in 2 seconds
