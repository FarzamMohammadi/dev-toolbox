# Docker Cleanser

Quickly nukes and resets your Docker environment by removing all containers, images, volumes, and custom networks, providing a clean slate. Optionally, it can also shut down WSL to fully reset Docker's virtual machine.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x docker-cleanser.sh

# Run
./docker-cleanser.sh
```
