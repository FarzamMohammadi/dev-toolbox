# Continue: Ultimate Prompt Engineering Directory

## Context

I'm continuing a previous session where we planned the Ultimate Prompt Engineering Directory. Here's everything you need to know to continue as if the chat never ended.

## Project Goal

Create a comprehensive prompt engineering ecosystem for AI-assisted senior software engineering, including:
- Philosophy files (like CLAUDE.md but more powerful)
- Skills to amplify AI capabilities
- Agents for autonomous task handling
- Tools and automation

## Current State

**Phase:** Planning COMPLETE → Ready for Implementation
**Immediate Next Step:** Create `philosophy/CORE.md`

### What's Done:
- ✅ Extensive industry research (CLAUDE.md, MCP, hooks, agents, memory, security)
- ✅ Creative ideas generated (9 philosophy files, 5 personas, 20+ skills, 20+ agents, 10 innovative concepts)
- ✅ User preferences captured in detail
- ✅ Pain points mapped to solutions
- ✅ `ULTIMATE-DIRECTORY-MASTER-PLAN.md` created (~1000 lines)
- ✅ `IMPLEMENTATION-PHASES.md` created (~400 lines)
- ✅ `/prepare-context-for-next-chat` slash command created for session handoffs
- ✅ Memory file structure established

### What's Next:
> **Note:** The writing toolkit has been created at `ai/toolkits/writing/`. The prompt engineering directory was restructured.

1. Explore or extend the writing toolkit
2. Add new toolkits to `ai/toolkits/`
3. Create new standalone prompts in `ai/prompts/`

## User Preferences (CRITICAL - Follow These)

**Interaction Style:**
- **80/20 Execution/Collaboration** - Tight partnership, not just task execution
- **Very Opinionated** - Push back, challenge my approaches, suggest alternatives
- **Strategic Comments Only** - Explain 'why' for non-obvious decisions, not verbose
- **Ask When Unclear** - Don't assume; use AskUserQuestion tool liberally

**Quality Expectations:**
- **Polish by Default** - First delivery is production-ready
- **Big Picture Thinking** - Consider system-wide impact automatically
- **Proactive Robustness** - Go above and beyond; bulletproof not just working
- **Challenge Assumptions** - Mention better alternatives even if contradicts request

**Workflow:**
- **Proactive Verification** - Run lint/build/tests before declaring done
- **Self-Review Summary** - Summarize what was done and concerns
- **Offer Final Polish** - End with "Would you like a final refinement pass?"
- **Flag Concerns Immediately** - Stop and raise issues before continuing
- **Boy Scout with Permission** - Ask: "Refactor along the way, or surgical + recommendations at end?"

## Memory Files to Read

Read these files for full context:
1. `ai/memory/session-history.md` - Latest session state
2. `ai/memory/learnings.md` - User preferences and knowledge
3. `ai/memory/decisions.md` - Decisions made with rationale
4. `ai/plans/ultimate-directory-master-plan.md` - Full plan with ready-to-use content

## Key Decisions Already Made

1. **Language-Agnostic** - Philosophy applies to all languages
2. **Pain Points Drive Priority** - Phase 1 solves most critical issues first
3. **Directory:** `ai/` with categorical structure (toolkits, prompts, agents, memory, plans, handoffs)
4. **Single CORE.md First** - One comprehensive file, can split later
5. **Ready-to-Use Blocks** - Master plan contains copy-paste content
6. **Slash Command for Handoffs** - `/prepare-context-for-next-chat`

## Ready-to-Use Content Location

The file `ai/plans/ultimate-directory-master-plan.md` contains ready-to-use markdown blocks for:
- Polish by Default mandate
- Big Picture Thinking mandate
- Proactive Robustness mandate
- Stay Current skill
- Challenge Everything mandate
- AI Engineering standards
- Partnership Workflow (80/20)
- Scope Discipline mandate

## Resume Instructions

1. Read `ai/memory/session-history.md` for latest state
2. Read `ai/memory/learnings.md` for my preferences
3. Read `ai/plans/ultimate-directory-master-plan.md` for the content to use
4. **Start implementing Phase 1:** Create `philosophy/CORE.md`

Treat this as a continuation - no need to re-explain context I've provided. Let's pick up exactly where we left off!

## Quick Start (Alternative)

If you want a one-liner instead:

> "Continue working on the AI tooling system. Read `ai/memory/session-history.md` and `ai/memory/learnings.md` for context. The writing toolkit is at `ai/toolkits/writing/`. See `ai/readme.md` for directory structure."
