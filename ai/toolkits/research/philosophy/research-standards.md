# Research Standards

> The quality principles and standards that govern all Research Parliament activities.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Evidence Over Opinion
Every factual claim must be supported by evidence. Opinions are valid but must be attributed and labeled as such. Never present opinion as fact.

### 2. Confidence Transparency
Never hide uncertainty. If evidence is limited, say so. If sources disagree, document it. Overconfidence is worse than acknowledged uncertainty.

### 3. Source Diversity
Seek evidence from multiple independent sources. A claim supported by many perspectives is stronger than one supported by many citations of the same source.

### 4. Adversarial Rigor
Actively seek counter-evidence. Research that doesn't look for problems isn't complete. The Skeptic and Critic exist because confirmation bias is real.

### 5. Intellectual Honesty
Report what you find, not what's convenient. If evidence doesn't support expected conclusions, report that. If the research reveals limitations in the topic, include them prominently.

## Quality Standards

### For Claims

**Strong Claim** (can state confidently):
- 2+ Tier 1-2 sources supporting
- No credible contradictions
- Verified independently
- Confidence >80%

**Moderate Claim** (state with caveats):
- Mixed tier support
- Minor contradictions resolved
- Some independent verification
- Confidence 50-80%

**Weak Claim** (state as tentative):
- Limited sources
- Unresolved contradictions
- No independent verification
- Confidence <50%

### For Sources

**Acceptable Sources**:
- Verifiable author or organization
- Clear provenance
- Appropriate for claim type
- Reasonably current

**Questionable Sources** (use with caution):
- Unknown authors
- Potential conflicts of interest
- Outdated for topic
- Low community validation

**Unacceptable Sources** (don't use alone):
- Anonymous without corroboration
- Obvious bias without disclosure
- Factually incorrect on verifiable points
- Spam or marketing disguised as content

### For Conclusions

**Valid Conclusion**:
- Supported by evidence presented
- Doesn't overreach beyond data
- Acknowledges limitations
- Considers alternatives

**Invalid Conclusion**:
- Extrapolates beyond evidence
- Ignores contradicting evidence
- Presents certainty without basis
- Conflates correlation with causation

## Mandatory Report Sections

Every research report MUST include:

1. **Confidence Indicators**
   - Per-claim confidence scores
   - Overall research confidence
   - Source quality summary

2. **Counter-Evidence Section**
   - This is NOT optional
   - If truly no counter-evidence exists, document the search
   - Minimum: note limitations and edge cases

3. **Source Provenance**
   - Every source must have URL
   - Every source must have tier
   - Key sources need credibility rationale

4. **Methodology Transparency**
   - How many searches conducted
   - What queries used
   - What sources were reviewed
   - How long spent

## Quality Gates

### Before Completing Research

- [ ] All sub-questions addressed
- [ ] Key claims have ≥2 sources
- [ ] Counter-evidence actively sought
- [ ] Contradictions resolved or flagged
- [ ] Confidence scores calculated
- [ ] Source tiers assigned
- [ ] Counter-evidence section populated

### Before Presenting Findings

- [ ] Executive summary accurate
- [ ] Key findings not overstated
- [ ] Caveats included where appropriate
- [ ] Sources properly cited
- [ ] Uncertainties acknowledged

---

## Depth-Specific Standards

### QUICK
- Accept lower confidence thresholds (40%)
- Focus on key facts only
- Minimal counter-evidence (note limitations exist)
- Fewer sources acceptable

### STANDARD
- Moderate confidence thresholds (60%)
- Balanced coverage
- Basic counter-evidence required
- Multiple sources for key claims

### DEEP
- Higher confidence thresholds (70%)
- Comprehensive coverage
- Full counter-evidence exploration
- Recursive depth on gaps

### EXHAUSTIVE
- Highest confidence thresholds (80%)
- Leave no stone unturned
- Counter-evidence is REQUIRED section
- Publication-grade rigor
- Every claim fully verified

---

## Ethical Standards

### Intellectual Integrity
- Don't cherry-pick evidence
- Don't suppress inconvenient findings
- Don't overstate confidence
- Don't plagiarize or misattribute

### Transparency
- Disclose methodology limitations
- Acknowledge when topics are outside expertise
- Note when sources may have conflicts
- Explain reasoning for judgments

### Responsibility
- Don't make dangerous claims without strong evidence
- Consider impact of conclusions
- Flag when professional consultation may be needed
- Don't provide advice beyond research scope

---

## When to Stop Research

Research is complete when:
1. All sub-questions have at least one answer meeting depth thresholds
2. Novelty exhausted (3 varied searches yield nothing new)
3. Contradictions resolved or explicitly flagged
4. Counter-evidence section populated
5. Quality gates passed

Research is NOT complete just because:
- A time limit was reached
- "Enough" sources were found
- The expected answer was confirmed
- One good source was found

## Quality Metrics

### Ideal Research Report

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Sources per key claim | ≥2 |
| Tier 1-2 source percentage | ≥30% |
| Claims with HIGH confidence | ≥50% |
| Claims with LOW confidence | ≤20% |
| Counter-evidence items | ≥3 |
| Unresolved contradictions | ≤2 |

### Red Flags

- No Tier 1-2 sources at all
- All sources from one perspective
- No counter-evidence found
- Many LOW confidence claims
- Conclusions don't follow from evidence
