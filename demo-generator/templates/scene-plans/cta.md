# Call-to-Action Scene

## Purpose
Close the loop. Tell the viewer exactly what to do next.

## Duration
3-8 seconds

## Content Formula
- **One clear action** — "Try it free", "Read the blog", "Star on GitHub"
- **URL or handle** — where to go
- **Brief reinforcement** — one line that reminds them why

## Recommended Animations
- `text-scramble` for the CTA text (final dramatic reveal)
- `fade-slide` for the URL/link
- `svg-tracer` for a logo if closing with branding
- `ripple` for a final visual flourish

## Beat Alignment
- CTA text on a strong downbeat
- URL/link fades in 1-2 beats after
- End cleanly — let the last beat ring out

## Design Notes
- Simplest scene visually — don't compete with the message
- Large text, high contrast
- URL should be easy to read even in a compressed video
- Can end with logo + tagline for brand reinforcement
