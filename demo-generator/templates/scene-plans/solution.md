# Solution Scene

## Purpose
Introduce what you built. This is the "aha" moment — the viewer should immediately understand what this is and why it matters.

## Duration
10-30 seconds

## Content Formula
- **Name it** — clear, confident introduction
- **One-liner** — what it does in one sentence
- **Key differentiators** — 2-3 things that make it special
- **Visual** — show the product/concept, not just text

## Recommended Animations
- `text-scramble` for the product name reveal (dramatic)
- `svg-tracer` for logo animation (draws itself into existence)
- `ripple` for emphasis on the logo/name
- `fade-slide` with stagger for feature bullet points
- `counter` for impressive stats

## Beat Alignment
- Strong downbeat for the name/logo reveal
- Subsequent beats for each feature point
- Let the visual breathe — don't rush

## Design Notes
- Shift color palette — brighter, more saturated than problem scene
- Use brand colors if applicable
- This is the hero moment — give it visual weight
- Can combine SVG logo trace + text scramble for maximum impact
