## Document Structure

### Opening Section

**Purpose:** Hook immediately, establish credibility, preview value

**Pattern:**
```markdown
# [Opening Section Title - action/benefit focused]

[Hook - 1-2 sentences that grab attention. Personal, relatable, or surprising.]

[Context setter - 1-2 sentences on what you'll deliver]

[Optional: Credibility marker - why you're qualified to write this]
```

**Voice Notes:**
- Start with personality (e.g., "Howdy!", "Here's the thing:")
- No throat-clearing or meta-commentary
- Get to value quickly

### Is This for Me Section (Optional but Recommended)

**Purpose:** Help readers self-select, create connection

**Pattern:**
```markdown
## Is this for me?

[Quick qualification - who should keep reading]

Let's play a quick game of "Does This Sound Familiar?":

- [Relatable pain point 1]?
- [Relatable pain point 2]?
- [Relatable pain point 3]?

If you nodded your head to even one of these, [personalized encouragement to continue].
```

### Quick Start / Quick Grasp Section

[Minimal steps to achieve result]

1. **[Step 1]:** [Brief instruction]
   ```bash
   [command]
   ```

[...]

That's it! [Brief confirmation of what they've achieved]

[Optional: "Want to understand what you just built? Keep reading."]

### Main Content Sections (3-5)

**Purpose:** Deliver the core value

**Pattern for each:**
```markdown
## [Section title - descriptive, sentence case]

[Examples, code, or visuals]
