## When to Create Full Source Cards

### Always Create For:
- All Tier 1 sources (primary/official)
- All Tier 2 sources (peer-reviewed)
- Any source cited 3+ times
- Any source that's the sole support for a claim
- Any controversial or disputed source

### Optional For:
- Tier 3 sources (create if heavily relied upon)
- Tier 4-5 sources (create if central to findings)

### Skip For:
- Tier 6 sources (brief citation is sufficient)
- Sources cited only for minor points
- Sources that merely corroborate well-supported claims
