# Demo / Walkthrough Scene

## Purpose
Show it working. Real data, real flow. This is the proof that backs up the claim.

## Duration
15-45 seconds (often the longest scene)

## Content Formula
- **Step-by-step** — show the actual workflow
- **Real data** — use realistic examples, not lorem ipsum
- **Before/after** — show input and output
- **Keep moving** — each step should transition smoothly to the next

## Recommended Animations
- `typewriter` for terminal/CLI demonstrations
- `fade-slide` for UI mockup elements appearing
- `counter` for results/metrics populating
- `text-scramble` for data transformations (input scrambles into output)

## Beat Alignment
- Each workflow step lands on a beat group (every 2-4 beats)
- Use beats to pace the demonstration — not too fast, not too slow
- Visual transitions between steps on downbeats

## Design Notes
- Can split into multiple scenes if the demo is complex
- Terminal scenes work great for CLI/developer tools
- Use cards/panels to show UI mockups
- Show real-looking data — makes it believable
- Progress indicators or step numbers help orientation
